My iOS apps I previously distributed on the App Store are available for installation via [AltStore PAL](https://altstore.io/).

Note that AltStore PAL is currently available only within EU member states.

## How to Install

First, download AltStore PAL from the [official website](https://altstore.io/download).

Next, open AltStore PAL using the link below and add Cizzuk's AltStore PAL source.

[Add Source to AltStore PAL](altstore-pal://source?url={{ site.data.meta.altstore.palsource }})

Alternatively, enter the following link in the AltStore PAL app:

```
cizz.uk/altstorepal
```

Once the source is added, you can find my apps either in the Browse tab or from the Cizzuk source.

Even if you have already downloaded the app from the App Store, you can switch to managing it via AltStore PAL. The content of the app remains the same regardless of the installation method.
